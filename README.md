# Waiting List App

A ReactJS application where users can join a waiting list either by entering their name or using an invite code. The app simulates real-time updates, adding random users to the list every 10 seconds. The app also displays alerts when users are successfully added.

## Features

- **Join Waitlist**: Users can join the waitlist by providing their name and an optional invite code.
- **Random User Addition**: Every 10 seconds, a random user is added to the waitlist, with or without an invite code.
- **Alerts**: Notifications are displayed when users are added to the waitlist, either manually or randomly. Alerts disappear after 3 seconds.
- **Real-time Updates**: The waitlist is updated dynamically every 10 seconds, and the UI reflects these changes.

- npm (v8.0 or above)
